The main objective of this project is to, given EEG data, try to find some patterns while applying some classification tools, that can help in some manner to make a faster and easier diagnosis of brain diseases in underdeveloped countries. 
To do so we build a classifier that will label any EEG recording as usable for further analysis or unusable
